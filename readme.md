## Features

- Smart window management

    hifvwm provides a feature-rich set of smart window managements.

- Capable of manipulating dozens or even hundreds of windows simultaneously 

    Most existing OS running on PC provides 1 desktop with a linear taskbar
    (such as Windows, MAC, Gnome2/3, Unity, KDE). These desktop environments
    confuse users while running dozens of window programs in 1 desktop and
    showing the titles in a linear taskbar. It is quit laborious to locate and
    switch the target window from these bunch of windows(even Window 10 and
    Gnome 3 have multiple desktops, the users couldn't see the whole bunch of
    windows clearly).

- Cognitively straightforward

    hifvwm provides a series of smart operations which favors human intuition.
    For example, while switching desktop, the non-overlapped, last focused
    window in the desktop view is focused automatically.

- Task oriented

    hifvwm provides easy-to-configure and easy-to-manage configuration
    structure. Users could set desktop number and page (sub-desktop) number as
    they want. This makes it easy for users to manipulate/organize windows. For example,
    I could organize my windows as following structure:

    Windows (Specific program, such as "GVIM", "Firefox") -> Pages (Sub-Task,
    specific functions, such as "Programing", "Web browsing") -> Desktops
    (Tasks, such as "research project 1", "research project 2") -> hifvwm

    hifvwm also provides a series of smart window switch operations. For
    example, hifvwm could recognize current window type, and navigate to any
    window opened with the same type. If, there are 100 windows running on my
    PC and if there are 20 Firefox windows, hifvwm could provides the Firefox
    window list (length is 20, instead of 100) for user to switch.

- View space saving

    Since most of the monitor nowadays are widescreen, it is not advisable to
    put the taskbar and menu bar horizontally, such as Windows/MAC/Gnome/KDE
    default, cause we do not need that wide screen to browse web page or edit
    text. hifvwm take the advantage of widescreen, puts large elements  (such
    as program icons, desktop thumbnails) vertically aligned to the left and
    right edge.

- Optimised key / mouse operation / mouse gesture

    For example, 

    1. hifvwm uses "Win" + "Space" to full-screen window, for they are the
       large keys, and full-screen is the most frequently used operation.
    2. hifvwm use "Win" + "B"  operation to navigate to Emacs Org-mode window
       (note book), then hit these keys again, it goes back automatically.

- Good-looking

    hifvwm provides a good-looking configuration default. hifvwm uses
    background of Bing.com as wallpaper and updates daily automatically.
    hifvwm provides a neat, transparent tool/task/desktop bar, and a feature
    rich conky configuration.

- Optimized positions 

    hifvwm optimized the position of each elements to make it cognitively
    straightforward.
